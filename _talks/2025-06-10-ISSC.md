This talk presents a novel framework for image blur detection using a **Universal Approximated Real-Valued Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**. The method leverages the universal approximation theorem to design a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) that approximates the real part of FFT outputs, enabling efficient blur detection in images.

Key contributions include:

- A real-valued FFT algorithm optimized for grayscale images, reducing computational complexity by exploiting conjugate symmetry.
- A fully connected ANN with a single hidden layer, trained to approximate FFT outputs with reduced neuron counts.
- Empirical validation using Kaggle image datasets (long-range, mid-range, short-range) with clear, defocused, and motion-blurred samples.
- Performance evaluation showing up to **45% computational reduction** while maintaining detection accuracy.
- Suitability for **resource-constrained edge devices**, such as those used in surveillance and autonomous systems.

This approach demonstrates a promising direction for integrating signal processing and neural approximation in real-time image analysis tasks.

Presented by **Xinghao Wang**, Queen's University Belfast, at ISSC 2025.
