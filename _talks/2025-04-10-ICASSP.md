This presentation introduced a **co-approximate framework** for parallel compressive depth reconstruction on FPGA.  

Key highlights included:  

- **Single Photon Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensing** with eye safety and SNR considerations  
- **Precision and power approximation** combining arithmetic approximation, voltage undervolting, and frequency overscaling  
- **Parallel processing design** with up to 64 processing units  
- **Approximate accelerator generation workflow** with Xilinx HLS-based synthesis  
- **Cost, performance, and fidelity trade-offs** under co-approximation  
- Demonstrated up to **60% power savings**, **significant speedups**, and **maintained depth image fidelity**  

The talk concluded with perspectives on error modeling, mixed-precision strategies, and compact low-power LiDAR sensing.
