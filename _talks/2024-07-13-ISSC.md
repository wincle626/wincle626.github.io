This talk presented a **checkerboard-style approximate K-SVD algorithm** tailored for resource-constrained embedded systems.  
Key contributions included:  

- Analysis of **resource-constrained environments** (size, weight, power, cost)  
- Development of **checkerboard K-SVD** using approximate linear algebra (SXLAL library)  
- Evaluation of compressed image quality via **PSNR and SSIM**  
- Comparison of floating-point, fixed-point, and posit (Unum) arithmetic  
- Demonstrated **up to 16Ã— reduction in computational complexity** while maintaining image quality  
- Achieved **up to 98% memory footprint reduction** using reduced precision  

The work showcased how approximate computing strategies can enable **efficient sparse representation** in embedded vision applications.
