This invited talk explored **Reconfigurable Approximate Computing in Autonomous Systems**, focusing on the balance between *energy efficiency* and *trustworthiness*. 

Key themes included:

- Approximate Linear Algebra and FPGA-based reconfigurability  
- Approximate accelerator generation and automation  
- Algorithmic and hardware resilience under approximation  
- Energy-efficient 3D depth reconstruction  
- Approximate model predictive control and PID controller benchmarks  
- Power scaling in fine-grained approximation

The talk highlighted both the **opportunities and challenges** of deploying approximation in autonomous systems under low-SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) constraints, emphasizing reliability, scalability, and security.
