I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in computing systems at Queen's University Belfast. My current research efforts concentrates on advance design methods and architecture for MPSoC and FPGA accelerators. I am interested in both software and hardware development for embedded systems.

I received MSc degrees in Electronic Engineering from Hunan University in 2007 and University of Southampton in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in Electronic & Computer Science from Queen's University Belfast in 2014. I previously worked at University of Cranfield, Cranfield, Heriot-Watt University, Edingburgh, and ZTE R&D Shanghai Plaza, China.

# Research Directions

* Approximate Computing
* Reconfigurable Accelerators and Security
* Low Size, Weight and Power - Cost (SWaP-C) Embedded Systems
* Artificial intelligence (AI) & Autonomous Systems (AS)
