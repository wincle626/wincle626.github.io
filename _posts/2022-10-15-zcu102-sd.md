# ZCU102_SD_Card_Setup

# This post will introduce setting up ZCU102 evaluation kit with Linux boot from SD card

## I. Operation system

### [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)

## II. Tools

### 1. [Xilinx Vivado 2019.1](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)

### 2. [Xilinx Vivado HLS 2019.1](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)

### 3. [Xilinx SDK 2019.1](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-design-tools.html)

### 4. [Xilinx PetaLinux 2019.1](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-design-tools.html)

## III. Source code

### 1. [Linux kernel](https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx)

### 2. [U-boot](https://github.com/Xilinx/u-boot-xlnx)

### 3. [Device tree](https://github.com/Xilinx/device-tree-xlnx.git)

### 4. [ARM Trusted Firmware](https://github.com/Xilinx/arm-trusted-firmware.git)

## IV. Prepare boot image from source

Refer to the similar process for ZCU106 evaluation board [(here)](https://github.com/wincle626/ZCU106_Setup/blob/master/docs/imagefromsource.md), the only differences are the u-boot and device tree.

For ZCU102 u-boot, use 'make xilinx_zynqmp_zcu102_revA_defconfig' to initiate the u-boot configuration. 

For ZCU102 device tree, either choose zcu102 board in vivado to generate the device tree or find built device tree at "linux-xlnx/arch/arm64/boot/dts/xilinx/zynqmp-zcu102-revA.dtb" or "u-boot-xlnx/arch/arm/dts/zynqmp-zcu102-revA.dtb"). 

## V. Prepare boot image from PetaLinux

Refer to the similar process for ZCU106 evaluation board [(here)](https://github.com/wincle626/ZCU106_Setup/blob/master/docs/imagefrompetalinux.md), the only difference is using the bsp for ZCU102 to create the petalinux project. 

For create petalinux project for zcu102, download the 'xilinx-zcu102-v2019.1-final.bsp' from Xilinx and execute command 'petalinux-create -t project -s ${path-to-source}/xilinx-zcu102-v2019.1-final.bsp'. Note that 'path-to-source' refers to the direction where the bsp is placed. 

## VI. Prepare SD card

It is the same process as ZCU106 evaluation board [here](https://github.com/wincle626/ZCU106_Setup/blob/master/docs/bootfromsdcard.md).

Additionally, instead of using the root file system from Xilinx, the generic debian or ubuntu version can be found at [https://rcn-ee.com/](https://rcn-ee.com/rootfs/eewiki/minfs/) or [http://cdimage.ubuntu.com](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/). 

E.g. 

a. Copy the debian-11-minimal-arm64-2021-06-20.tar.xz to ext4 partition on SD card and extract it using 'xz -d debian-11-minimal-arm64-2021-06-20.tar.xz'

b. Extract the rootfs files to ext4 partition using command 'tar xfvp debian-11-minimal-arm64-2021-06-20.tar ./'

Once the board is boot up, the network needs to be configured through netplan. The easist way is to adopt DHCP configurations. By create a '.yaml' file under '/etc/netplan' with context:

```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: true
```
use 'netplay apply' to apply the configuration and use 'ip route show' to check the network setting. 

More detail can be found on Ubuntu Network Configuration document [(here)](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/network-configuration).

Ubuntu has provided official sysroot files for Xilinx Ultrascale+ MPSoC Evaluation boards. Details can be found [(here)](https://ubuntu.com/download/xilinx).

## Some known issues

In case meeting the issue of "pmu-fw is not running", it can be solved by following the pictures bellow and setting the SW6 switch correctly.
