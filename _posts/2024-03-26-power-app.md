# This is simple app for monitoring power consumption on Xilinx Ultrascale+ ZCU106

## Based on Linux Kernel 4.19 and QT 6.4.0

## Runs on ARM with X11 forward to the host through ssh by just simply execute "./PowerMonitor"

### Save Figure

Save curretly visiable figure to sd card

### Save Data

Save currently visualized data to sd card

### Open Binary

Select a FPGA configuration binary and configure it

### Power Rail

Select corresponding power rail and restart the visulization

### Voltage Scaling Range 0.65 ~ 0.95

Change the voltage value for a specific power rail or enter a voltage value for it

### Frquency Scaling Factor 0.01 ~ 10

Change the ratio of input clock rate to the FPGA, e.g. if the FPGA is running at 250MHz, factor=0.5 means 125Mhz

## Note that: Due to the fact that ZCU106 and ZCU102 has the same power rail sequence and PS ARM processor, this app can be also used for ZCU102.
