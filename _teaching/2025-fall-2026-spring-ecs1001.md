# Concurrent Programming

This undergraduate course introduces the principles and practice of concurrent programming, focusing on multi-threaded and distributed systems. Students will learn how to design, implement, and reason about concurrent programs using modern programming languages and tools.

## Course Objectives

• Understand the basic structure of a computer program, using both Python and the C
programming languages.
• Understand the basic structure of an MCU (Microcontroller Unit)
• Understand how to develop software for an MCU.
• Understand how basic analogue and digital interface circuits are designed for an MCU.
• Understand how to develop event-driven ISR (Interrupt Service Routines).
• Understand how Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are designed and constructed.

## Topics

1. Introduction to Computer Programming using Python
2. Introduction to Embedded Systems Programming using Arduino C
3. Introduction to Microcontroller Electronics
4. Introduction to Printed Circuit Board Design
