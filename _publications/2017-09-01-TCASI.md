This paper presents a novel detection algorithm for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, which combines bounded selective spanning with extended fast enumeration techniques. The proposed algorithm aims to enhance detection performance while maintaining computational efficiency, addressing the challenges posed by high-dimensional signal spaces in MIMO systems.

Key contributions include:

- **Bounded Selective Spanning**: Introduction of a bounded selective spanning technique that reduces the search space for potential solutions, thereby improving detection speed.

- **Extended Fast Enumeration**: Development of an extended fast enumeration method that efficiently explores the reduced search space, further enhancing detection performance.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm's performance in terms of detection accuracy and computational complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness in MIMO-OFDM systems.
