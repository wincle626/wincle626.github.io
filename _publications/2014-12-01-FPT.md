This paper addresses the challenge of power management in heterogeneous ARM/FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. The authors propose a methodology for power modeling and capping, aiming to optimize energy efficiency in embedded systems. The approach is validated through experimental results, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.

Key contributions include:

- **Power Modeling**: Development of a power modeling technique tailored for ARM/FPGA SoCs, enabling accurate estimation of power consumption.

- **Power Capping**: Introduction of a power capping mechanism to limit power usage, ensuring energy efficiency without compromising performance.

- **Experimental Validation**: Validation of the proposed methodology through experiments, showcasing its applicability in embedded systems.
