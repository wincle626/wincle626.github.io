This paper presents an adaptive fixed-complexity sphere decoder designed to enhance energy efficiency in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. The proposed decoder dynamically adjusts its decoding complexity based on the modulation order, thereby reducing energy consumption without significantly compromising decoding performance.

Key contributions include:

- **Adaptive Complexity Adjustment**: The decoder adapts its computational complexity in real-time, depending on the modulation order, leading to energy savings.

- **Fixed-Complexity Implementation**: Despite the adaptive nature, the decoder maintains a fixed worst-case complexity, ensuring predictable performance.

- **Performance Evaluation**: The proposed decoder is evaluated in terms of decoding error rate and energy consumption, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing energy usage while maintaining decoding accuracy.
