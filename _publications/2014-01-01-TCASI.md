This paper presents a configurable quasi-optimal sphere decoding algorithm aimed at improving the scalability and efficiency of MIMO communication systems. By adjusting the decoding process based on the system's requirements, the proposed method offers a balance between performance and computational complexity.

Key contributions include:

- **Configurable Decoding**: The algorithm allows for dynamic adjustment of decoding parameters to suit varying system configurations.

- **Performance Enhancement**: Achieves near-optimal detection performance while reducing computational overhead.

- **Scalability**: Demonstrates the ability to scale effectively with increasing MIMO system dimensions.
