This paper addresses the demand for easily programmable, high-performance image processing platforms based on FPGAs. The authors present a novel, high-performance processor—IPPro—and demonstrate its application to the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) algorithm on a Xilinx Zynq platform. The study identifies and explores various mapping strategies to improve processing efficiency for soft-cores and examines options for creating a division coprocessor.

Key contributions include:

- **IPPro Processor**: Introduction of the IPPro processor, a high-performance soft-core designed for image processing tasks.

- **Mapping Strategies**: Exploration of mapping strategies to enhance processing efficiency for soft-cores.

- **Division Coprocessor**: Investigation of options for creating a division coprocessor to optimize performance.

- **Performance Validation**: Validation of the approach using the HOG algorithm, achieving a performance of 328 frames per second (fps), representing a 146% speed improvement over the original realization and a tenfold reduction in energy consumption.
