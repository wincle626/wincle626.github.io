This paper addresses the challenge of balancing detection accuracy and hardware cost in Sphere Decoders (SD) for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems, particularly in constrained environments like IoT. The authors introduce a Robust Bounded Spanning with Fast Enumeration (R-BSFE) method that enhances channel matrix pre-processing and symbol enumeration to maintain quasi-maximum-likelihood (ML) accuracy while reducing computational complexity by up to 74%.

Key contributions include:

- **Robust Bounded Spanning with Fast Enumeration (R-BSFE)**: Novel strategies for pre-processing and symbol enumeration that reduce complexity and maintain quasi-ML detection accuracy.

- **High-Performance FPGA Implementation**: Design of accelerators for 802.11n on Xilinx FPGA achieving lower cost and higher throughput.

- **Cost-Accuracy Trade-off**: Provides configurable SD designs to balance detection performance against accelerator cost, suitable for power-constrained MIMO systems.

- **State-of-the-Art Results**: Demonstrated as the highest performance, lowest cost quasi-ML SD accelerators reported in literature.
