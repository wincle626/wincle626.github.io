This paper addresses the limitations of the Selective Spanning Fast Enumeration (SSFE) algorithm in detecting high-order modulation schemes in MIMO-OFDM systems. The authors propose Bounded Selective Spanning with Extended Fast Enumeration (BSS-EFE), an enhancement that improves detection performance and reduces computational complexity.

Key contributions include:

- **Algorithm Enhancement**: Introduction of BSS-EFE to overcome SSFE's limitations in spanning modulation schemes of 16-QAM or higher.

- **Performance Improvement**: Achieving up to a 1 dB Bit Error Rate (BER) gain compared to SSFE.

- **Efficiency Gains**: Reducing computational complexity by up to 16.3%, making the approach more suitable for real-time implementations.

- **Experimental Validation**: Demonstration of the proposed method's effectiveness through FPGA-based detectors for 2×2 and 4×4 16-QAM 802.11n MIMO systems.
