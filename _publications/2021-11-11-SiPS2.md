This paper presents a mixed precision framework for compressive depth reconstruction using a compact Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) solver tailored for the ℓ₁-norm regularized least squares problem. The proposed approach dynamically adjusts the precision of arithmetic operations during iterative optimization to balance performance and resource utilization.

Key contributions include:

- **Compact ADMM Solver**: Development of an efficient ADMM algorithm optimized for FPGA architectures, enabling real-time depth reconstruction.

- **Mixed Precision Strategy**: Implementation of a mixed precision scheme that varies the bit-width of arithmetic operations, achieving significant reductions in hardware resource usage and power consumption.

- **FPGA Implementation**: Realization of the proposed solver on an FPGA platform, demonstrating over 55% savings in hardware resources and 78% reduction in power consumption compared to single-precision floating-point implementations, with minimal degradation in depth reconstruction quality.
