Depth image reconstruction from sparse samples is essential for machine perception applications (robotics, autonomous vehicles, etc.), especially under tight power, speed, and resource constraints. This paper presents a **co-approximate parallel compressive depth reconstruction engine** on FPGA that leverages:

- ℓ₁ solvers (proximal gradient descent),  
- instrumented frequency and voltage scaling during iterative optimization, and  
- multiple parallel approximate processing units.

By exploring different numbers of parallel processing units and approximation levels, the design achieves: **~51% extra power savings**, **~421% speed-up** over a nominal configuration, yielding over **43× efficiency improvement**.
