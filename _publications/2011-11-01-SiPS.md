This paper addresses the challenge of efficient detection in MIMO systems with adaptive modulation. The authors propose a Tree-Based Adaptive Spatial Detection (TASD) method that leverages the modulation order to dynamically adjust detection complexity, thereby improving detection performance and reducing computational cost.

Key contributions include:

- **Tree-Based Detection**: Introduction of a tree-based approach that adaptively prunes the search space according to the modulation scheme.

- **Adaptive Modulation Handling**: Efficiently supports varying modulation orders, optimizing performance for each scenario.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Simulation and experimental results demonstrate improved Bit Error Rate (BER) performance with lower computational complexity compared to conventional detection methods.
