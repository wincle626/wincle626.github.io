This paper addresses the challenge of efficient detection in large-scale Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems by proposing an FPGA-based implementation of the Tabu Search algorithm. The authors aim to balance detection performance with computational complexity, making the approach suitable for real-time applications in large-scale MIMO systems.

Key contributions include:

- **FPGA Implementation**: Development of an FPGA-based architecture to accelerate the Tabu Search algorithm, enhancing its applicability in real-time systems.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessment of the proposed implementation's performance in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Scalability Analysis**: Examination of the scalability of the approach in large-scale MIMO systems, highlighting its potential for high-dimensional data detection.
