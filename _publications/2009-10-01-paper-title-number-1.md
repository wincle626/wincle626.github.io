AxRA introduces a novel approximate Rowhammer attack framework designed for modern DRAM architectures. The work explores approximation strategies to exploit memory cell vulnerabilities while reducing attack overhead, enabling new insights into hardware security threats in next-generation systems. The paper further discusses countermeasures and validation on real DRAM platforms.
