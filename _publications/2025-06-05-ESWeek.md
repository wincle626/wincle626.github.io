This article examines the emerging challenges in **Approximate Computing**, especially focusing on optimizing the trade-offs between output accuracy and non-functional metrics: Power, Performance, and Area (PPA). It analyses the current scope of approximate computing techniques, identifies limitations in existing methods, and proposes design considerations and research directions for pushing beyond present trade-offs. The work also highlights future challenges, including new abstractions, tool support, hardware-software co-design, and benchmarking for accuracy-PPA optimization.
