This paper presents a novel approach to FPGA-based MIMO-OFDM detection by introducing a Cooperative Actor Oriented Synthesis (CAOS) methodology. The proposed CAOS framework aims to enhance the modularity and reusability of hardware designs, facilitating the development of flexible and efficient systems for modern wireless communication standards.

Key contributions include:

- **Actor-Oriented Design**: Adoption of an actor-oriented paradigm to model and synthesize hardware components, promoting modularity and ease of integration.

- **FPGA Implementation**: Realization of the proposed design on FPGA platforms, demonstrating feasibility and performance.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Analysis of the system's performance in terms of throughput, resource utilization, and scalability.
