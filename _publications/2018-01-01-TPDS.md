This paper addresses two significant limitations in current Signal Flow Graph (SFG) architectural synthesis approaches for FPGA accelerators: the inability to efficiently utilize programmable datapath components and the lack of automatic derivation of accelerators to meet specific throughput or latency requirements. The authors propose a novel synthesis approach that derives software-programmable multi-core Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) accelerators from SFG models, incorporating offline characterization of multicore performance and compile-time program analysis to meet prescribed throughput requirements.

Key contributions include:

- **Multi-SIMD Architecture**: Development of an architectural synthesis approach that leverages programmable datapath components in modern FPGAs to create multi-core SIMD accelerators.

- **Performance Estimation**: Introduction of offline performance estimation techniques to predict the performance of the synthesized accelerators and ensure they meet specified throughput requirements.

- **Case Study**: Application of the proposed approach to the design of transceivers for 802.11n WiFi, demonstrating the effectiveness of the synthesis technique in achieving real-time performance.
