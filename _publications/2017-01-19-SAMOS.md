This paper addresses the challenge of managing power consumption in heterogeneous System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures by introducing a runtime system that enables adaptive power capping. The proposed system dynamically adjusts the power budget allocated to different components of the SoC, balancing performance and power consumption to meet system-level constraints.

Key contributions include:

- **Adaptive Power Capping**: Development of a runtime system that monitors and adjusts the power consumption of heterogeneous SoC components, ensuring compliance with power budgets while maintaining performance.

- **Performance-Power Trade-offs**: Analysis of the trade-offs between performance and power consumption, providing insights into how adaptive power capping can be leveraged to optimize system behavior.

- **Implementation and Evaluation**: Implementation of the proposed system on a heterogeneous SoC platform and evaluation of its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its capability to adapt to varying workloads and power constraints.
