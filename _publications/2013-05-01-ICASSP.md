This paper introduces a novel soft-core implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on Xilinx Virtex FPGA technology. By employing a streaming processing architecture, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to achieve architectures offering 1.1 GSamples/s throughput and up to 19 times speed-up against the Xilinx Radix-2 FFT dedicated circuit with comparable cost.

Key contributions include:

- **Soft-Core Implementation**: Development of a soft-core FFT implementation on FPGA, providing flexibility and reconfigurability.

- **Streaming Architecture**: Utilization of a streaming processing architecture to enhance throughput and efficiency.

- **Performance Evaluation**: Achievement of 1.1 GSamples/s throughput and up to 19 times speed-up over the Xilinx Radix-2 FFT dedicated circuit.
