This paper addresses the challenge of real-time pre-processing in Fixed-Complexity Sphere Decoders (FSD) for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. The authors propose an FPGA-based architecture that reorganizes the ordering and QR decomposition sub-operations to reduce resource cost by 50% while maintaining real-time performance.

Key contributions include:

- **FPGA-Based Architecture**: Development of an FPGA-based pre-processing architecture that enhances efficiency in FSD applications.

- **Resource Optimization**: Achieving a 50% reduction in resource cost compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

- **Real-Time Performance**: Ensuring real-time performance suitable for 4×4 802.11n MIMO systems.
