This paper addresses the challenges of deploying LASSO-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) on resource-constrained systems, such as embedded platforms, due to the intensive memory usage and computational cost as the horizon length increases. The authors propose a reduced-precision implementation of the Lean Proximal Gradient Descent (LPGD) algorithm, tailored for FPGA platforms.

Key contributions include:

- **Reduced Precision Approximation**: The LPGD algorithm is adapted to operate with reduced precision, significantly lowering hardware resource requirements.

- **FPGA Implementation**: The approximate LPGD solver is implemented on an FPGA, demonstrating substantial reductions in logic cost (up to 60%), memory bandwidth (up to 80%), and power consumption (up to 70%), while maintaining comparable control performance to high-precision solvers.

- **Reconfigurable Design**: The proposed design is reconfigurable, allowing for adaptability to different system requirements and constraints.
