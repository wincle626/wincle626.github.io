This paper tackles the problem of precision optimization in implementing PID control loops on hardware. Using *affine arithmetic*, the authors automatically estimate the minimal required precision (bit-widths) for both floating-point and fixed-point representations (exponent & mantissa or integer & fractional parts). Benchmarks are applied to 1-D feedback-loop (PID) systems. Hardware FPGA implementations show substantial savings: **~62% average reduction in area** and **~27% average reduction in power**, when compared to using uniform bit widths. The work provides a template for automating accuracy vs resource trade-offs in embedded PID control systems.
