This paper presents a preprocessing technique for sphere decoding that employs modified squared Givens rotations. The proposed method aims to reduce the computational complexity associated with traditional preprocessing steps in sphere decoding algorithms, thereby enhancing the efficiency of hardware implementations.

Key contributions include:

- **Modified Squared Givens Rotations**: Introduction of a novel rotation technique that simplifies the preprocessing phase of sphere decoding.

- **Computational Complexity Reduction**: Demonstration of how the proposed method leads to a reduction in the number of operations required during preprocessing.

- **Hardware Efficiency**: Analysis of the impact of the proposed technique on hardware resources, highlighting improvements in efficiency.
