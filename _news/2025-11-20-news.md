Welcome Mr. Xinyuan Zhao to visit Queen's University Belfast !

Xinyuan Zhao is a Ph.D. candidate in Information and Communication Engineering at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA). His research focuses on Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), with particular emphasis on silicon photonic PUFs and hardware security for low-power and highly reliable systems. His work investigates the extraction and amplification of process variations in photonic and electronic devices, aiming to improve PUF stability, reliability, and resistance to environmental variations. He has experience in photonic PUF design based on Mach–Zehnder interferometers, true random number generation, and authentication protocols between photonic and electronic chips.
