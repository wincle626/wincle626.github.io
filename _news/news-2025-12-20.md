Happy to share our recent successful NVIDIA Academic Grant!

Our research group at Queens University Belfast is honored to be a recipient of this support. NVIDIA's generous donation of 4x Jetson Orin Nano Dev Kits will significantly enhance our research capabilities in computational efficiency and safety for edge AI.

We are excited to push forward our work in developing advanced computing techniques and are grateful for the opportunity to leverage NVIDIA technology in our academic pursuits.
